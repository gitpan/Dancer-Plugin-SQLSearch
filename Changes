Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-SQLSearch

0.03    2011-12-30
        Search terms are now AND'ed when the search is performed over a
        single database field. (Suggested by Naveed Massjouni).
        A test accompanies the new behavior. Another test is included to
        verify we have exact phrase searches when the search query is between
        double quotes.

        Removed config.yml from distribution. By having it, you needed
        YAML to run tests. This caused cpan testers failed reports.
